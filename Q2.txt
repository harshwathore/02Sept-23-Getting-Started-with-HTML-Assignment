In HTML, comments are used to add explanatory notes or annotations within the code. Comments are not displayed on the web page when it's rendered in a browser; instead, they serve as a way for developers to document their code, make notes, or temporarily disable certain parts of the code.

The syntax for HTML comments is as follows:
<!-- This is a comment -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- This is a comment explaining the purpose of the following paragraph -->
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

    <!--
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It provides additional information about the structure of the document.
    -->

    <div>
        <!-- This comment is used to temporarily disable the following code -->
        <!-- <p>This paragraph is temporarily disabled.</p> -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
